All compile-time parameters are injected via `parameters/mqom3_parameters_<variant>.h`,
selected automatically from the four-tuple `MQOM3_PARAM_SECURITY`, `MQOM3_PARAM_BASE_FIELD`,
`MQOM3_PARAM_TRADEOFF`, `MQOM3_PARAM_OT_VARIANT`. The public API follows the NIST convention:
`crypto_sign`, `crypto_sign_open`, `crypto_sign_keypair` in `crypto_sign.c`.

Two additional entry points sit alongside `Sign`/`Verify` without altering them: `Sign_Prepare`/
`Sign_Finalize` (`sign_pre.c`) split signing into a message-independent precomputation and a
short finalization once the message is known, and `StreamedVerify_*` (`verify_stream_ct.c` /
`verify_stream_ot.c`) verifies a signature incrementally from arbitrary-sized chunks instead of
the whole buffer at once. See [Pre-Signatures](#pre-signatures) and
[Streaming Verification](#streaming-verification) below.

## Quick Usage

The `manage.py` Python script is the recommended interface. To compile one or several schemes:

```bash
python3 manage.py compile [schemes ...]
```

where `[schemes ...]` is a non-empty list of MQOM instances in the format
`<category>_<base-field>_<trade-off>_<blc>`:
* `<category>` is `cat1`, `cat3`, or `cat5` (128-, 192-, or 256-bit security);
* `<base-field>` is `gf2` or `gf16`;
* `<trade-off>` is `shorter` (for `gf2` only), `fast` or `short` (for `gf16` only);
* `<blc>` is `ct` (Correlated Trees) or `ot` (One Tree).

You can use prefix-based wildcards. For example:
* `cat3` selects all Category III instances;
* `cat1_gf16` selects all Category I instances over GF(16);
* `all` selects all 18 instances.

```bash
python3 manage.py compile all
python3 manage.py compile cat1_gf16_fast_ct
python3 manage.py compile cat3 --no-kat --no-bench
```

It is also possible to compile directly with `make` using the `MQOM3_VARIANT` variable:

```bash
make clean && make MQOM3_VARIANT=cat1_gf16_fast_ct sign
make clean && make MQOM3_VARIANT=cat5_gf2_shorter_ot kat_gen
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run KAT generation + verification for one instance
python3 manage.py test cat1_gf16_fast_ct

# Run all 18 instances in parallel without valgrind
python3 manage.py test all --no-valgrind -p -1

# Run with sanitizers (ASan + UBSan)
make MQOM3_VARIANT=cat1_gf16_fast_ct USE_SANITIZERS=1 kat_check

# Embedded KAT self-test (no I/O, suitable for cross-compilation)
make MQOM3_VARIANT=cat1_gf16_fast_ct test_embedded_KAT
```

## Running Benchmarks

```bash
python3 manage.py bench cat1_gf16_fast_ct -n 100
```

or directly:

```bash
make MQOM3_VARIANT=cat1_gf16_fast_ct bench
./bench 100
```

## Pre-Signatures

`Sign()` splits naturally into a message-independent phase (BLC commit, PIOP evaluation) and a
short message-dependent phase (challenge sampling, BLC opening). `sign_pre.h` exposes that split
at two levels:

```c
/* Recommended: high-level, randomized wrappers - salt/mseed/mask_rnd are
 * generated internally (no caller-supplied randomness left to reuse), and
 * presig is wiped by crypto_sign_finalize() after use (success or failure),
 * so reusing that same buffer fails cleanly instead of silently succeeding. */
int crypto_sign_prepare(uint8_t presig[MQOM3_PRESIG_SIZE], const uint8_t sk[MQOM3_SK_SIZE]);

int crypto_sign_finalize(uint8_t sig[MQOM3_SIG_SIZE], unsigned long long *siglen,
                          const uint8_t *msg, unsigned long long mlen,
                          const uint8_t sk[MQOM3_SK_SIZE], uint8_t presig[MQOM3_PRESIG_SIZE]);

/* Low-level, deterministic primitives underneath - caller supplies all
 * randomness. For KAT generation, testing, or callers with their own CSPRNG;
 * see the SECURITY note above their declarations in sign_pre.h before using
 * these directly. */
int Sign_Prepare(const uint8_t sk[MQOM3_SK_SIZE], const uint8_t salt[MQOM3_PARAM_SALT_SIZE],
                  const uint8_t mseed[MQOM3_PARAM_SEED_SIZE],
                  const uint8_t mask_rnd[MQOM3_PARAM_PRESIGN_RND_SIZE],
                  uint8_t presig[MQOM3_PRESIG_SIZE]);

int Sign_Finalize(const uint8_t sk[MQOM3_SK_SIZE], const uint8_t *msg, unsigned long long mlen,
                   const uint8_t presig[MQOM3_PRESIG_SIZE], uint8_t sig[MQOM3_SIG_SIZE]);
```

The result of either level is byte-identical to a direct `Sign()` call with the same
`(salt, mseed, msg)`.

**Single use only.** `(salt, mseed, mask_rnd)` must be fresh, uniformly random, and never reused
across two `Sign_Prepare()` calls for the same `sk`; a given `presig` must be passed to
`Sign_Finalize()` for at most one message. 

`crypto_sign_prepare`/`crypto_sign_finalize` only partially remove this burden from the caller.
The randomness half is fully solved: there is no caller-supplied `(salt, mseed, mask_rnd)` left to
accidentally reuse. The presig half is not: `crypto_sign_finalize` wipes its `presig` argument in
place after use, so calling it again with that *same buffer* fails cleanly instead of silently
reopening the commitment - but a caller who copied `presig` before that call (persisted it, sent
it elsewhere, kept a second reference, ...) can still finalize that copy against a different
message and reopen the same commitment. That operational discipline - never persist or duplicate
a `presig` you intend to finalize only once - is still entirely on the caller at both API levels;
see the comment above the declarations in `sign_pre.h` for the full reasoning.

The `presig` is masked with an XOF keyed on `sk || mask_rnd` (only the 256-bit `mask_rnd` is
stored in clear), so it is safe against a passive eavesdropper while kept or transmitted outside
the signer between the two calls - but the mask is confidentiality-only, not an integrity tag,
and it does nothing to prevent the single-use requirement above from being violated by the
application itself.
Both levels are compiled in for every build, CT and OT alike, with no dedicated flag to set.
`MQOM3_PRESIG_SIZE` is a small, fixed constant per variant, independent of
`MEMORY_EFFICIENT_BLC`/`BLC_KEEP_ALL_TREES_IN_MEMORY`: `Sign_Prepare`/`Sign_Finalize` always
serialize a compressed, seed-based form of the BLC opening key (the "ckey": the master seed plus
the auxiliary values, with the salt and - for CT - the correlated-tree offset left out, since
both are recovered at parse time) into `presig`, never the
fully-expanded GGM tree that `BLC_KEEP_ALL_TREES_IN_MEMORY` builds cache purely as an internal
RAM/CPU tradeoff for `Sign()`/`Verify()` - that cache has no reason to leak into a persisted
pre-signature. One consequence: a `presig` produced by any build of a given variant (default or
`MEMORY_EFFICIENT_BLC=1`) is byte-compatible with `Sign_Finalize`/`crypto_sign_finalize` in any
other build of that same variant.

```bash
make MQOM3_VARIANT=cat1_gf16_fast_ct test_presign
./test_presign
```

## Streaming Verification

`StreamedVerify_*` (`verify_stream.h`) is an alternative to `Verify()` that consumes a signature
incrementally through an Init/Update/Finalize/Clean state machine, instead of requiring the whole
`MQOM3_SIG_SIZE`-byte signature in memory up front - useful when a signature arrives piecemeal
(network, flash read, etc.).

```c
stream_verify_ctx_t *StreamedVerify_Init(const uint8_t pk[MQOM3_PK_SIZE]);
int StreamedVerify_Update(stream_verify_ctx_t *ctx, const uint8_t *sigpart, size_t sigpartlen);
int StreamedVerify_Finalize(stream_verify_ctx_t *ctx, const uint8_t *msg, unsigned long long mlen);
void StreamedVerify_Clean(stream_verify_ctx_t *ctx);
```

Call `Update()` as many times as needed with arbitrary chunk boundaries (they need not line up
with any internal structure), then `Finalize()` once all `MQOM3_SIG_SIZE` bytes have been fed in.
Always call `Clean()` last, regardless of outcome - including after an `Update()` failure or an
abandoned stream where `Finalize()` is never reached - to release the context.

* `STREAM_VERIFY_BATCH=N` - number of repetitions buffered between two PIOP recomputation
  passes (default: `PIOP_NB_PARALLEL_REPETITIONS_VERIFY`); lower it for less peak memory, at
  the cost of more (smaller) PIOP calls.
* OT memory floor: the shared large tree is reconstructed as soon as the opening prefix
  (`T_open` path, hidden leaf commitments, `delta_x`) has arrived - in
  `BLC_OT_BATCH_SIZE`-sized passes, not one monolithic one - but the `alpha1` section only
  comes *after* that prefix in the byte stream, and the PIOP needs both. So
  `x_eval`/`u_eval`/`com1` for all `tau` repetitions stay resident from the tree pass through
  `Finalize()` regardless of `STREAM_VERIFY_BATCH` or `BLC_OT_BATCH_SIZE`; the batch size
  still bounds the tree traversal's own working set, just not the context's. The CT variant
  has no such floor: its `alpha1` is interleaved per-execution chunk, so it streams execution
  by execution. (Note this floor is specific to the *streamed* verifier; `Verify_memopt` reads
  the whole signature and therefore does shrink these buffers to `BLC_OT_BATCH_SIZE`.)

Like `Sign_Prepare`/`Sign_Finalize`, `StreamedVerify_*` is compiled in for every build and needs
no dedicated flag: it calls the memopt BLC/PIOP primitives directly by name, independently of
whatever `Verify()` itself is built with.

```bash
make MQOM3_VARIANT=cat1_gf16_fast_ct test_verify_stream
./test_verify_stream
```

## Advanced Usage

### Variant Parameters

The four compile-time axes are set via preprocessor variables and select the appropriate
parameter header from `parameters/`:
* `MQOM3_PARAM_SECURITY`: security level in bits; `128` (Cat I), `192` (Cat III), `256` (Cat V);
* `MQOM3_PARAM_BASE_FIELD`: log2 of the base field order; `1` for GF(2), `4` for GF(16);
* `MQOM3_PARAM_TRADEOFF`: `0` (fast), `1` (short), `2` (shorter - GF(2) only);
* `MQOM3_PARAM_OT_VARIANT`: `0` for CT (Correlated Trees), `1` for OT (One Tree).

These are normally set automatically by `MQOM3_VARIANT`. You can inspect the resulting
`EXTRA_CFLAGS` for a given instance with:

```bash
python3 manage.py env cat1_gf16_fast_ct
```

### Optimization Flags

**Rijndael/AES backend** - exactly one of the seven below is active, and selecting two is a
compile-time error (`rijndael/rijndael.h`). Selecting none lets `rijndael/rijndael_platform.h`
auto-detect, with priority VAES > AES-NI > ARM AES > bitslice:
* `RIJNDAEL_BITSLICE=1` - portable constant-time bitsliced implementation (default on
  non-x86/non-ARM platforms); adapted from [BearSSL](https://bearssl.org/constanttime.html);
* `RIJNDAEL_TABLE=1` - table-based implementation, faster but not constant-time;
* `RIJNDAEL_CONSTANT_TIME_REF=1` - constant-time flavour of the portable reference
  implementation (`rijndael/rijndael_ref.c`); correct and side-channel-conservative, but the
  slowest of the backends - meant as a readable baseline rather than a deployment choice;
* `RIJNDAEL_AES_NI=1` - AES-NI instruction set (x86, constant-time);
* `RIJNDAEL_VAES=1` - VAES (Vector AES) for batched Rijndael; auto-detected when compiling with
  `-march=native` on a VAES-capable CPU (`__VAES__` takes priority over AES-NI); within VAES, uses
  512-bit registers (AVX-512, 4 lanes/instruction) when `AVX512F+BW` are available, otherwise
  256-bit registers (AVX2, 2 lanes/instruction); note: `FORCE_PLATFORM_AVX2/AVX512` do not imply
  VAES since they do not pass `-mvaes` to the compiler - use the `*_VAES` profiles below for that;
  the x2/x4/x8 key schedule is
  further accelerated with GFNI (`VGF2P8AFFINEINVQB`) - both AES-128 (cat1) and Rijndael-256-256
  (cat3 and cat5) - when the compiler target provides it
  (`__GFNI__`, e.g. `-march=native` on a GFNI-capable CPU); opt out with
  `NO_RIJNDAEL_VAES_GFNI_KEYSCHED=1`;
* `RIJNDAEL_ARM_AES=1` - ARMv8 Crypto Extension hardware AES (AArch64 and ARMv7 with Crypto
  Extension); constant-time; auto-detected when `__ARM_FEATURE_CRYPTO` or `__ARM_FEATURE_AES` is
  defined (i.e. `-march=native` on ARMv8+crypto, or `FORCE_PLATFORM_AARCH64_AES`);
* `RIJNDAEL_EXTERNAL=1` - the implementation comes from the integrator. `rijndael_external.c`
  only ships `weak` placeholders, which the caller's own symbols override at link time; the
  expected symbols and their contract are in `rijndael/rijndael_external.h`. MQOM3 calls the
  `*_enc*` routines with `data_in == data_out`, so an external backend must read its whole
  input group before writing any output - one that cannot must add
  `RIJNDAEL_NO_INPUTS_ALIASING=1`.

**Rijndael modifiers** - these are *not* backends and do not belong to the exclusive set above;
they combine with whichever backend is active:
* `RIJNDAEL_OPT_ARMV7M=1` - dedicated ARMv7-M assembly (Category I only); uses the
  [LUT from SAC2016](https://github.com/Ko-/aes-armcortexm) for table mode or the
  ["fixsliced" implementation from TCHES2021](https://github.com/aadomn/aes) for bitslice -
  so it refines `RIJNDAEL_TABLE` or `RIJNDAEL_BITSLICE` rather than replacing them;
* `USE_WEAK_LOW_LEVEL_API=1` - makes Rijndael and Keccak symbols `weak`, allowing the caller
  to override them at link time with a hardware-accelerated backend (e.g. for embedded targets
  with a CRYP engine). Orthogonal to the backend choice: it changes symbol binding, not which
  implementation is compiled in - unlike `RIJNDAEL_EXTERNAL`, which compiles none.

**GF(256) multiplication tuning:**
* `NO_FIELDS_REF_SWAR_OPT=1` - disable the SWAR (SIMD Within A Register) optimization in the
  portable `FIELDS_REF` path; SWAR packs 4 GF(256) multiplications into one 32-bit word
  (`GF256_MULT_X4`), is constant-time, and is on by default;
* `USE_GF256_TABLE_MULT=1` - non-constant-time 65 kB multiplication table (faster on embedded
  targets without cache-timing risk);
* `USE_GF256_TABLE_LOG_EXP=1` - non-constant-time smaller log/exp tables (exclusive with the
  above);
* `GF256_MULT_TABLE_SRAM=1` - place the large multiplication table in SRAM instead of flash
  (constant cache behavior; only meaningful with `USE_GF256_TABLE_MULT=1`).

**Field arithmetic** (selected automatically, can be forced):
* `FIELDS_REF=1` - portable C reference (fallback when no SIMD is detected);
* `FIELDS_AVX2=1` - AVX2 (+ GFNI if available);
* `FIELDS_AVX512=1` - AVX-512 (+ GFNI if available);
* `FIELDS_NEON=1` - ARM NEON implementation (AArch64 and ARMv7+NEON); auto-detected on
  little-endian ARM only. The backend is little-endian by construction, so big-endian ARM
  falls back to `FIELDS_REF` and forcing `FIELDS_NEON=1` there is a compile-time error.
  Big-endian targets also need an explicit `KECCAK_PLATFORM=opt64` (or `plain32`);
* `NO_GFNI=1` - disable GFNI even when the CPU supports it.

**Keccak/XOF implementation** (auto-detected, can be forced):
* `KECCAK_PLATFORM=avx512|avx2|aarch64|arm32_neon|armv7m|opt64|plain32` - force a specific Keccak
  backend; auto-detection priority follows this order: `avx512` (x86-64 + AVX-512VL+F) >
  `avx2` (x86-64 + AVX2) > `armv7m` (ARMv7-M/EM) > `aarch64` (AArch64) > `arm32_neon`
  (ARMv7A+NEON) > `opt64` (portable 64-bit fallback);
* `USE_XOF_X4=1` - enable x4 parallel XOF (default on, disable with `USE_XOF_X4=0`);
* `USE_XOF_X8=1` - enable x8 parallel XOF; auto-enabled on `avx512` (native times8 kernel)
  and `aarch64` (2xtimes4 mlkem-native assembly); otherwise opt-in.

**Platform profiles** (force a complete platform configuration):
* `FORCE_PLATFORM_REF=1` - pure C, no `-march=native`;
* `FORCE_PLATFORM_AVX2=1` - AVX2 + AES-NI;
* `FORCE_PLATFORM_AVX2_GFNI=1` - AVX2 + AES-NI + GFNI;
* `FORCE_PLATFORM_AVX2_VAES=1` - AVX2 + VAES (adds `-mvaes`, so Rijndael auto-selects
  `RIJNDAEL_VAES` at its 256-bit sub-level instead of AES-NI);
* `FORCE_PLATFORM_AVX2_VAES_GFNI=1` - same plus GFNI, which also turns on the GFNI-accelerated
  VAES key schedule;
* `FORCE_PLATFORM_AVX512=1` - AVX-512 + AES-NI;
* `FORCE_PLATFORM_AVX512_GFNI=1` - AVX-512 + AES-NI + GFNI;
* `FORCE_PLATFORM_AVX512_VAES=1` - AVX-512 + VAES; `-mvaes` together with `-mavx512f` is what
  opens the 512-bit VAES forms, so this one lands on the `RIJNDAEL_VAES512` sub-level;
* `FORCE_PLATFORM_AVX512_VAES_GFNI=1` - same plus GFNI and the GFNI key schedule;
* `FORCE_PLATFORM_AARCH64=1` - AArch64, NEON fields, bitsliced Rijndael (no crypto extension);
* `FORCE_PLATFORM_AARCH64_AES=1` - AArch64, NEON fields, ARM hardware AES (`armv8-a+crypto`);
* `FORCE_PLATFORM_AARCH64_SHA3=1` - AArch64, NEON fields, bitsliced Rijndael, accelerated
  Keccak via SHA3 extension (`armv8-a+sha3`);
* `FORCE_PLATFORM_AARCH64_AES_SHA3=1` - AArch64, NEON fields, ARM hardware AES, accelerated
  Keccak via SHA3 extension (`armv8-a+crypto+sha3`);
* `FORCE_PLATFORM_ARM32_NEON=1` - ARMv7A+NEON, NEON fields, bitsliced Rijndael.

**Memory optimization** (for embedded or memory-constrained contexts):
* `MEMORY_EFFICIENT_BLC=1` - memory-optimized BLC (recomputes GGM paths instead of storing
  all leaves); required by `VERIFY_MEMOPT`;
* `MEMORY_EFFICIENT_PIOP=1` - memory-optimized PIOP (streams MQ matrices instead of
  materializing them); required by `VERIFY_MEMOPT`; incompatible with `USE_PIOP_CACHE` and
  `PIOP_BITSLICE`;
* `MEMORY_EFFICIENT_KEYGEN=1` - streaming MQ matrix generation during KeyGen;
* `SIGN_MEMOPT=1` - optimized signing processing repetitions in batches, mirroring
  `VERIFY_MEMOPT` (implies `MEMORY_EFFICIENT_BLC=1` and `MEMORY_EFFICIENT_PIOP=1`);
* `VERIFY_MEMOPT=1` - optimized verification processing repetitions in batches (implies
  `MEMORY_EFFICIENT_BLC=1` and `MEMORY_EFFICIENT_PIOP=1`);
* `SIGN_MEMOPT_STREAM_COM1=0/1` / `VERIFY_MEMOPT_STREAM_COM1=0/1` - stream the `com1` digests
  into `presig_id` batch by batch instead of keeping the whole `TAU`-sized array until the
  end. Trades one always-live `xof_context` for `(TAU - batch) * DIGEST_SIZE`, so it only
  pays off once the repetitions are actually batched - which is exactly the default: each
  flag is on iff its path is batched (`SIGN_MEMOPT_BATCH < TAU`, resp.
  `VERIFY_MEMOPT_BATCH < TAU`, where that effective batch is
  `PIOP_NB_PARALLEL_REPETITIONS_SIGN`/`_VERIFY` for CT and `BLC_OT_BATCH_SIZE` for OT).
  Override either one to force the behavior; the two are independent, since signing and
  verification have separate batch parameters. Output is byte-identical either way;
* `USE_PIOP_CACHE=0` - disable the PIOP cache (enabled by default; incompatible with
  `MEMORY_EFFICIENT_PIOP=1`);
* `BLC_DEFAULT_NO_KEEP_TREES=1` - do not keep full GGM trees in memory in the default BLC path
  (saves memory at the cost of recomputation; overridden by `MEMORY_EFFICIENT_BLC=1`);
* `PRG_ONE_RIJNDAEL_CTX=1` - use a single Rijndael context for PRG and PRG_pub;
* `SEED_COMMIT_MEMOPT=1` - memory-optimized seed commitment using a single Rijndael context;
* `BLC_NB_LEAF_SEEDS_IN_PARALLEL=N` - number of leaf seeds processed in parallel in the BLC
  memopt path (tune for memory/cycles trade-off; must divide `MQOM3_PARAM_NB_EVALS`; defaults
  to 8 in the fast-folding path, or to 1 in the slow-folding path - see `BLC_NO_FAST_FOLDING`
  below for what a value above 1 costs there);
* `BLC_NO_FAST_FOLDING=1` - skip the `NB_EVALS_LOG`-sized fast-folding scratch buckets in the
  BLC memopt path, accumulating each leaf's contribution directly into the output instead
  (`NB_EVALS` field multiplications instead of `NB_EVALS_LOG`, but no extra buffer); only has
  an effect where BLC memopt is compiled in (`MEMORY_EFFICIENT_BLC=1` or `VERIFY_MEMOPT=1`),
  CT and OT alike. `BLC_NB_LEAF_SEEDS_IN_PARALLEL` still defaults to 1 here (unchanged
  minimal-memory behavior), but an explicit value above 1 is supported too.
  This allows to explore multiple time-memory trade-offs.
* `GGMTREE_NB_ENC_CTX_IN_MEMORY=N` - number of GGM encryption contexts kept in memory;
* `SMALL_GGM_TREE_NB_SIMULTANEOUS_LEAVES_LOG=N` - log2 of the number of GGM leaves processed
  simultaneously in the batch tree path;
* `BLC_SEEDEXPAND_CACHE` - SeedExpand cache: **on by default** in the default BLC path
  (auto-defined in `blc_ct_default.c`/`blc_ot_default.c`); opt out with `NO_BLC_SEEDEXPAND_CACHE=1`; off by
  default in the memopt path, opt in with `BLC_SEEDEXPAND_CACHE=1`;
* `BLC_SEEDCOMMIT_CACHE=1` - enable SeedCommit cache in the memopt path (off by default);
* `USE_ENC_X8=1` (default on) / `USE_ENC_X8=0` - use x8 batched encryption in SeedExpand;
  set to `0` to reduce memory at a cycles cost;
* `USE_SIGNATURE_BUFFER_AS_TEMP=1` - reuse the output signature buffer as scratch storage
  during signing (avoids a temporary allocation).

**OT-specific tuning** (only relevant for `blc=ot` variants):
* `BLC_OT_BATCH_SIZE=N` - number of executions processed per large-tree traversal pass
  (default: `TAU`); reduce to trade memory for extra tree traversals. Under `SIGN_MEMOPT` /
  `VERIFY_MEMOPT` this is also the effective batch of the whole OT path. On the
  signing side it sizes `x0`/`u0`/`u1` (and `com1` once streaming is on); on the
  verification side `x_eval`/`u_eval`/`alpha1` (and `com1` likewise). Note the one
  buffer it does *not* shrink: `alpha0`/`alpha1` on the signing side stay `TAU`-sized
  as soon as you batch, because they must survive until the Hash_1/com2 pass - at the
  default they cost nothing only because they alias `u0`/`u1`, which batching gives
  up. So the first step below `TAU` hands back `2 * TAU * ETA` bytes before the batch
  starts paying. Dropping below `TAU` also turns `com1` streaming on (see
  `SIGN_MEMOPT_STREAM_COM1` above). The PIOP then consumes that window in sub-batches of
  `PIOP_NB_PARALLEL_REPETITIONS_SIGN`/`_VERIFY`;
* x8 batches are used for the large-tree BFS expansion by default whenever the encryption
  backend provides them (`USE_ENC_X8`, itself on by default), since x8 consistently
  outperforms x4; set `NO_LARGE_TREE_BFS_X8=1` to force the x4 batching path instead;
* `NO_LARGE_TREE_BFS=1` - use DFS instead of BFS for the large OT GGM tree (BFS is on by
  default for OT variants);
* `LARGE_GGM_TREE_INCR_BATCH=1` - in the memopt (DFS, `MEMORY_EFFICIENT_BLC=1`) large-tree
  traversal only, batch 2 independently-keyed tree nodes per derivation step (1 x2 encryption
  call instead of 2 separate ones) instead of deriving one node at a time; off (`0`) by
  default. Only pays off with a x2 (at least) Rijndael backend (e.g. bitsliced Rijndael
  `RIJNDAEL_BITSLICE=1`). **This flag governs the signing side only** - see the Verify
  counterpart just below. Byte-identical output either way (it only changes which block
  cipher entry point is used, not what is computed);
* `LARGE_GGM_TREE_INCR_BATCH_VERIFY=1` - same x2 pair batching, but for the *verification*
  side of the memopt large-tree traversal; off (`0`) by default **even when
  `LARGE_GGM_TREE_INCR_BATCH=1`**, deliberately. The two sides are switched independently
  because their trade-off differs: signing drives the constant-time (typically bitsliced)
  cipher, where pairing two derivations into one x2 call is a clear win; verification only
  handles public data and therefore drives the *public* cipher (typically table-based), which
  has no multi-key parallelism to exploit. 

**PIOP parallelism and bitslicing:**
* `PIOP_BITSLICE=1` - bitsliced PIOP across all `tau` repetitions (incompatible with
  `MEMORY_EFFICIENT_PIOP=1`); tuned by:
  * `FIELDS_BITSLICE_COMPOSITE=1` - use a composite field representation;
  * `FIELDS_BITSLICE_PUBLIC_JUMP=1` - allow branches on public inputs;
  * `BITSLICE_HYBRID_LEFTOVER_LIMIT=N` - threshold below which leftover repetitions fall back
    to the scalar (non-bitsliced) path (default: 10; must be ≤ 32);
* `PIOP_NB_PARALLEL_REPETITIONS_SIGN=N` / `PIOP_NB_PARALLEL_REPETITIONS_VERIFY=N` - batch
  repetitions to reduce buffer memory at the cost of extra recomputation cycles. Both default
  to `TAU`, i.e. no batching. For CT under `SIGN_MEMOPT`/`VERIFY_MEMOPT` these are the
  effective batch, so dropping below `TAU` also turns `com1` streaming on; for OT the
  effective batch is `BLC_OT_BATCH_SIZE` instead and these only size the PIOP sub-batches
  inside it.

**Security / cleansing:**
* `USE_ENC_CTX_CLEANSING=1` - cleanse Rijndael key schedule contexts after use
  (disabled by default for performance; enable in security-sensitive contexts).
  Forced on when building for liboqs (`MQOM3_FOR_LIBOQS`, see `common.h`), where cleansing
  is mandatory - do not expect the default there.

**Sanitizers:**
* `USE_SANITIZERS=1` - compile with ASan + UBSan + LSan.

## Embedded Targets

The MQOM3 implementation is designed to be portable. Cross-compilation for bare-metal Cortex-M4
targets is supported by passing `CC=arm-none-eabi-gcc` and appropriate `EXTRA_CFLAGS` to `make`.
The `test_embedded_KAT` target produces a self-contained binary (no filesystem I/O) suitable
for cross-compilation and simulation.

Further details, benchmarks, and a ready-to-flash firmware for STM32 boards (STM32F4Discovery
and Nucleo-L4R5ZI) are available in the [dedicated embedded repository](https://github.com/mqom/embedded-mqom).
Additional experimental optimizations for embedded platforms are described in the paper
[Breaking the Myth of MPCitH Inefficiency: Optimizing MQOM for Embedded Platforms](https://eprint.iacr.org/2026/078.pdf).

## Benchmark Tables (`bench_table.py`)

`bench_table.py` turns benchmark runs into the Markdown or LaTeX tables used in the
specification. It can drive the whole chain itself - compile the binaries through `manage.py`,
run the bench, format the result - or work from a JSON file produced earlier.

```bash
# All in one: compile, bench 100 repetitions, print Markdown
python3 bench_table.py --compile --format md -n 100

# Only category 1, compiling in parallel, as LaTeX
python3 bench_table.py --compile -j -1 --format latex cat1

# Binaries already in build/: bench and format only
python3 bench_table.py --format md -n 100

# From an existing run, no compilation and no bench
python3 bench_table.py -i stats/bench.json --format latex
```

The positional argument selects what to measure: `all`, a category (`cat1`, `cat3`, `cat5`),
or a single variant such as `cat1_gf16_fast_ct`. The JSON consumed by `-i` is what
`manage.py bench -o FILE` writes, so a long campaign can be run once and reformatted freely.

**Choosing the columns**

* `--sizes` - add the pk, sk and signature size columns;
* `--cycles` - real cycle counts through RDPMC, for KeyGen/Sign/Verify only;
* `--detailed` - build with `BENCHMARK=1`, which adds the per-step breakdown of signing and
  implies `--cycles`;
* `--no-cycles` / `--no-ms` - drop one of the two units (`--no-ms` needs cycles to be on);
* `--mem-usage` - build with `MEASURE_STACK=1` and add a stack/heap table. Only takes effect
  together with `--compile`, since it changes how the binaries are built;
* `--instances-parameters` - emit the MQ/proof parameter and key/signature size tables. These
  come from the parameter headers, so this one needs neither binaries nor a bench run.

**Two knobs that are easy to confuse**

`-j` parallelises *compilation* and is safe to raise: it does not touch a measurement.
`-p` parallelises the *benchmarks* themselves and defaults to sequential on purpose - concurrent
runs contend for CPU and cache, which pollutes both the millisecond and the cycle figures. Leave
`-p` at 0 for anything meant to be published.

`--cycles` and `--detailed` read hardware performance counters; what that needs, and how to
make the numbers reproducible, is the next subsection.

### Stable cycle measurement

On Linux the cycle source is `perf_event_open()` with `PERF_COUNT_HW_CPU_CYCLES`: real hardware
PMU cycles, and architecture-independent. On x86-64 a direct userspace register read (RDPMC) is
layered on top as a fast path, which avoids one syscall per sample. `benchmark/timing.c`
therefore has three possible sources, in decreasing order of quality:

* `RDPMC` - direct register read, x86-64 only, what published figures should use;
* `READ` - the perf file descriptor works but RDPMC is unavailable: still real PMU cycles, one
  syscall per sample;
* `FALLBACK` - `perf_event_open()` itself failed, so an architecture-specific free-running
  counter is used. This is *not* a PMU cycle count.

`STRICT_CYCLES=1` is the default and makes `ticks_setup()` fail loudly rather than accept either
downgrade, on the principle that a degraded measurement that looks like a real one is worse than
an explicit failure. Set `STRICT_CYCLES=0` to accept the fallback with a warning instead. Access
to the counters needs:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w kernel.perf_event_paranoid=2
```

**Turbo boost and frequency scaling.** Cycle counts are frequency-independent only to first
order, so leaving the clock free to move does perturb them, not just the millisecond columns.
The memory subsystem does not scale with the core clock: a cache miss or a DRAM access costs
roughly a fixed amount of *time*, hence more core *cycles* when the core runs faster.
Two runs at different boost states can therefore disagree by
several percent on cycles alone, with nothing wrong in either.

For figures meant to be compared or published, pin the clock before measuring.

**Frequency extrapolation**

`--current-freq` and `--target-freq` rescale the millisecond columns from the clock the run
actually happened at to another one; cycle counts are left alone, being frequency-independent.
This is an approximation valid between two clock speeds of the *same* microarchitecture, a base
and a boost clock for instance - it says nothing about a different CPU, whose IPC differs.
`--projected-cycles` goes the other way and *derives* a cycle column from the milliseconds,
discarding any real counter data; it is meant for platforms with no usable cycle counter, macOS
being the usual case.
